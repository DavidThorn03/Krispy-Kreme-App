This is a web application for a mock Krispy Kreme website

It consisits of a node js api controller which interacts with users through a next.js view to provide relevant data from a MongoDB model database

The website includes pages that allow users to view products, add products to their cart, see and manipulate their cart and order products
It features bcrypt for password hashing and uses node mailer to send users email confirmation of their order (not in site now to avoid email authentification info in site)

It also includes a manager user, which can view all orders placed by users
