# Krispy Kreme
 
https://rich-web-assignment.vercel.app/

This project was completed for the Rich Web Applications module

This is a web application for a mock Krispy Kreme website

This involved creating a web application using Next.js front end, Node.js API, a weather API and MongoDB atlas, which was then hosted on Vercel.

The app used GitHub as its version control system, which was also where the source files used by Vercel were stored.

The app included features to allow user to log in or register an account, view products and add them to their cart, view their current cart items, which were stored in the MongoDB database, and check out when they are done reviewing their cart, which will send the user an email confirming their order.

The app also allowed manager to view all orders placed by the users.

The app featured user sessions, using iron sessions, to store user information, database API which could retrieve, remove and add database entries and the node mailer to send confirmation emails to the user. 

In earlier development of the app, before hosting it online using MongoDB atlas and Vercel, a docker was used for database connections.
